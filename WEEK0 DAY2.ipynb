    "1. In python return is used to return the control of the program back to the main function\n",

    "2. While return it can return either nothing or something like string,numbers like int,float etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can imagine many scenarios where you don’t just want a function to perform an action but also to return a value back to the main function. For example, rather than simply printing the calculation of x + y, you may want a function to return the value of this calculation back to another part of your program. This “passing back” of a value we call a return value."
